# AntiSpamBot

AntiSpamBot is a simple Bukkit plugin which prevents players from using chat until they have moved in-game. All this does is helps prevent spam bots from joining and spamming the chat unless the character actually moves around.

##FAQ

Q: Does the plugin have any commands?
A: Currently, no. This may change though.

Q: Am I able to configure the message displayed to players when they try to chat before they have moved?
A: Yes, you sure can! Simple navigate to the plugin's folder and open up the config.yml. Here there is an option called 'move-to-chat' under a section called 'messages' where you can insert your own custom message to display instead of the default one.
